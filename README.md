# MECSteamFix
Hinting towards a fix for Mirror's Edge Catalyst on the Steam platform

Only for legit buyers of the game that are fed up with ea play or whatever their shitty launcher is called now.

# Explanation and usage

Buy the game on steam (it's very worth it trust me bro)

Download it so that the play button is green

sail to the seven seas and get the good version

delete all the ea crap from your drive and install decent version

copy decent version files to actual steam location

run the fuckea.reg

play the game without being bothered by ea launcher

actual fun

# Technical explanation

When you click Play in Steam, Steam will actually call the following URL

`link2ea://launchgame/1233570?platform=steam&theme=mec`

which is handler for the ea app and all it does is to launch your game from the ea launcher ?????????????????????????

so the only correct conclusion is to set up this handler yourself and hijack it and decide what is done when this is called.

Should also work with Jedi Fallen Order
